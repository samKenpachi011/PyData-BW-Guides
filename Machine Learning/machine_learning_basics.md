# What is Machine Learning?

#### Machine Learning (ML) VS Artificial Intelligence (AI)
>Basically, AI is a branch of computer science that is concerned with making smart machines that perform tasks that would require human intelligence whereas ML just falls under AI.

## Components of Machine Learning
* **Data** - Set of values of qualitative or quantitative variables. This is the most important component, because even the finest algorithms cannot produce good results if the data is garbage. "Garbage in, Garbage out."
* **Features** - Also known as parameters, these are the factors machines will look at.
* **Learning Agents** - A function which maps a feature vector to a discrete class value.

## How Machine Learning Works
1. Select and prepare training data.
2. Choose an algorithm to run on training data.
3. Train algorithm to create a model.
4. Use and improve the model.
## Machine Learning Methods
* ### Supervised learning 
  >The machine is trained with correctly labeled data.That is, the data is labeled with information that the machine learning model is being built to determine and that may even be classified in ways the model is supposed to classify data.
* ### Semi-supervised learning
  >The machine is trained without labeled data. It uses algorithms to extract features needed to label, classify, and sort the data in real time.
* ### Unsupervised learning
  >This method sits between supervised and unsupervised learning. During training, it uses a smaller labeled data set to guide classification and feature extraction from a larger, unlabeled data
* ### Reinforcement learning
  >Behavioral machine learning model that is similar to supervised learning, but the algorithm isnâ€™t trained using sample data. This model learns as it goes by using trial and error. A sequence of successful outcomes will be reinforced to develop the best recommendation or policy for a given problem.

## Learning objectives / Interview Questions
1. Identify problems that can be solved with machine learning.
2. Differentiate between supervised learning and unsupervised learning.
3. Describe how model training and testing works.
4. Describe commonly used algorithms including linear regression, logistic regression, and k-means.
5. What are performance metrics in machine learning?
6. List a few metrics to evaluate ML models in different applications based on two categories: Classification and Regression.
7. Evaluate the performance of a machine learning model using metrics.
